My favorite design pattern: ContextAPI

I have a lot of ReactJS/NodeJS projects on my GitLab but I don't want to make them public, I can give you an invitation to access them :

- Automated multi-strategy crypto trading system in NodeJS
- Automated forex trading system in Python
- Site connected to the blockchain which allows you to track your earnings in ReactJS / Web3
- Blockchain explorer in NodeJS, with for example the possibility of detecting and positioning yourself before everyone else on new projects
